## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

**1. Prerequisites:**
   - A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
   - A local web server to serve the files. The [Live Server extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is a great option.

**2. Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nairobi-tent-masters.git
   cd nairobi-tent-masters
   ```

**3. Set up Environment Variables:**
   This project requires an API key for the Google Gemini API to power the custom order feature.

   - **Crucially, the application expects the API key to be available in the browser's environment**. In this project's `index.html`, this is simulated for development purposes.
   - For your local setup, you need to create a mechanism to provide this key. A simple way is to create a `.env` file (which should NOT be committed to git).
   - Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
   - Copy the content from `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
   - Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_super_secret_api_key_here
     ```
   **Important**: The application code as provided by the prompt expects `process.env.API_KEY` to be defined. In a real production deployment, this key must be managed securely and should not be exposed on the client-side. The current setup is for demonstration and local development only.

**4. Run the Project:**
   - If you are using the **Live Server** extension in VS Code, simply right-click the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".
   - Alternatively, serve the project root directory using any local web server.
